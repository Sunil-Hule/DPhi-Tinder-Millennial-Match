# DPhi-Tinder-Millennial-Match
## Problem Statement
Tinder is a casual dating site that allows users to make split-second decisions to determine if they like a potential match. The user swipes right on the profile to match the potential suitor. If the potential suitor also swipes right, a match is made and both parties are alerted.

Tinder is a massive phenomenon in the online dating world. Because of its vast user base, it potentially offers lots of data that is exciting to analyze. 
We have collected a small dataset which explains the match rate of the individuals from different universities, and whether the app has helped them find a relationship.


## Objective
You are required to build a machine learning model that would predict if an individual succeeded with a relationship or not (It became a successful relationship or not).
